### Simple Shop Online

So let's say there are 4 products in an online shop, an apple is 0.3$, a beer is 2$, water is 1$ each bottle and cheese is 3.74$ each kg. They have been stored in Mysql DB

Create a simple interface where:
- I can add/remove products to my virtual shopping cart in any quantities
- I can see my current cart status
- I have to choose a shipping option between 'pick up' (USD 0) and 'UPS' (USD 5). No option is chosen by default, so if I don't choose one and click on “Pay”, the interface asks me to select one. 
- After clicking on 'pay' (Originally my balance is USD 100 and after the purchase the remaining balance is stored) I want to see the previous balance, total purchase cost and my remaining balance after paying. 
- The shop should be in English only including code comments
- Please write this shop using PHP7.2 OOP
- Near each product there is a rating scale from 1 to 5, I can rate it and I can see current average rating of each product. Rating should only be allowed once per session or once per user and rates are stored using Mysql DB.
- Some CSS/html/JS so it looks a little better

General requirements
- DRY;
- Neat and consistent style;
- Understandable names;
- Clear logic flow (avoiding spaghetti code), short methods;
- Minimal reliance on global state: e.g. usage of superglobals. A separate place processing them should be dedicated.

OOP requirements
- Logic should be fully inside classes including ajax controller (except, maybe, Views);
- Separation of concerns: one class is responsible for a single thing;
- Minimum (or zero) amount of static methods;
- Encapsulation;
- Existence of entities / models like ShoppingCart;
